Expand code selection
Press   Ctrl W   to expand code selection. 
Each time you press   Ctrl W  , the selection expands to other areas of code.
For example, the selection expands from a method name 
to the expression calling this method, 
then to the whole statement, 
then to the containing block, 
and so on.
