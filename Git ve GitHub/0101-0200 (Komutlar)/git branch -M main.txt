"git branch -M main" is a command
in the Git version control system. 
It is used to rename the current branch to "main."



git": This is the Git command-line tool 
used for version control.


"branch": This subcommand is used for 
managing branches in a Git repository.


"-M": This is an option for the "branch" subcommand. 
In this context, it stands for "move/rename" and 
is used to rename a branch.


"main": This is the new name you want to assign 
to the current branch. In Git, it is common to rename 
the default branch from "master" to "main" 
as a more inclusive and culturally sensitive alternative.


So, when you execute the "git branch -M main" command, 
it renames the current branch to "main" in 
your Git repository. This can be useful when 
you want to change the name of the default branch or 
for other branch management purposes.
